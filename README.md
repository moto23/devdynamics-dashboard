# Getting Started with Create React App

This project provides a detailed visualization of developer activities, including commits, pull requests, merges, meetings, and documentation, over a specified date range. The data is fetched from an API and displayed using various types of charts for easy analysis.

## Features
### Line Chart: Displays the developer activities over time, allowing you to track trends and patterns.
### Bar Chart: Provides a segmented view of different activities over the selected date range.
### Pie Chart: Offers a proportional view of the overall contributions of different activities within the selected date range.
### Date Filters: Allows you to specify a start and end date to view activities within a custom range.
### Summary Statistics: Displays the total counts for each activity type within the selected date range.
### Contributors Daywise Activity:Displa Activity metrics of each user

## Tools and Technologies

- **Framework**: React
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS (or any CSS-in-JS library like styled-components)
- **Charts**: Any charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, D3.js)

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://devdynamics-dashboard.vercel.app/](https://devdynamics-dashboard.vercel.app/) to view it in the browser.


1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moto23/devdynamics-dashboard.git

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Install dependencies:

### `npm install`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
